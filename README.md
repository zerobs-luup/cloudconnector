# LUUP - CloudConnector

Connect your Cloud-Infrastructure to [LUUP](https://luup.zero.bs/index.en.html) -
AttackSurfaceMonitoring and see what services and applications
you have exposed publicly.

It is basically a middleware that collects IPs used in your projects
and sends them to the LUUP-API for a frequent and regulary update.

You can use flatfiles as well. 

Please find additional information about setup and usage in the 
[docs](docs) - folder.
